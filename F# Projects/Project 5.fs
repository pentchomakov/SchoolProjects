(* This is the top-level function.  It reads an input string and outputs the parse tree.
It is not recursive at top level but the main guts of it consists of three
mutually-recursive functions called expr, term and primary.  There is also a function
called getsym which returns the next character from the input string.  getsym is imperative
and uses the mutable local variables sym and cursor.  Please do not change the definition of
getsym or the declarations of sym and cursor.  No doubt all this can be done more slickly,
but I am trying to be as simple-minded as possible. *)
